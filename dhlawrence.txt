I.

Ah, stern, cold man,	
How can you lie so relentless hard	
While I wash you with weeping water!	
Do you set your face against the daughter	
Of life? Can you never discard	
Your curt pride's ban?	

You masquerader!	
How can you shame to act this part	
Of unswerving indifference to me?	
You want at last, ah me!	
To break my heart	
Evader!	

You know your mouth	
Was always sooner to soften	
Even than your eyes.	
Now shut it lies	
Relentless, however often	
I kiss it in drouth.	

It has no breath	
Nor any relaxing. Where,	
Where are you, what have you done?	
What is this mouth of stone?	
How did you dare	
Take cover in death!
